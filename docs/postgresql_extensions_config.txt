# PostgreSQL Extensions in Django

At present, the only required extension is:

- postgis
  (plpgsql is also installed by default with PostgreSQL)

To enable PostGIS in your database, run:

    CREATE EXTENSION postgis;

This note serves as a lightweight internal reference.  
As the project grows, a more structured way to ensure consistency
across environments (local, UAT, PROD) will be required. In particular, 
Django provides migration operations for extensions, such as CreateExtension:
